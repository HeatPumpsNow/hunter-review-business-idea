# Key Questions for Technical Partner

## Core Concept Validation

### Is this just consulting with AI buzzwords?
**Our position**: We're building reusable components and templates, not doing bespoke development for each customer. AI helps with initial domain modeling, but humans validate and configure.

**Questions for partner**:
- Is 80% component reuse realistic across customers in the same industry?
- How do we prevent this from becoming a consulting business with platform overhead?
- What technical constraints help enforce the template-first approach?

### What does ownership really mean?
**Current thinking**: Customers own their configured instance and data, we maintain the underlying platform and component library. Updates are opt-in packages they can review.

**Questions for partner**:
- Is this ownership model technically sound at scale?
- How do we handle critical security updates that can't be optional?
- What are the legal and operational implications of this model?

### How do updates work if customers own the code?
**The challenge**: How do you push improvements to software customers "own"?

**Possible approaches**:
- Customers own source code, we manage deployment/hosting
- Updates delivered as opt-in packages with change documentation  
- Core platform owned by us, customer configurations owned by them

**Questions for partner**:
- Which approach is most technically feasible?
- How do successful platforms handle this (WordPress plugins, Salesforce customizations)?
- What's the simplest viable update mechanism?

## Technical Architecture Questions

### What happens when edge cases don't fit templates?
**The challenge**: Complex businesses have unique requirements that may not fit standard components.

**Current thinking**:
- Start with narrow industry focus to maximize template coverage
- Build 80/20 rule into business model (reject customers who don't fit)
- Handle edge cases through limited professional services

**Questions for partner**:
- How do successful platforms handle the long tail of requirements?
- What's the right approach when customer needs exceed template coverage?
- How do we prevent edge cases from breaking the platform model?

### How do we handle multi-tenant deployments at scale?
**The challenge**: Managing 100+ customer-specific deployments efficiently.

**Current thinking**: Each customer gets their own deployment for true ownership.

**Questions for partner**:
- Single-tenant vs multi-tenant trade-offs for our ownership model?
- What's the real operational cost of managing many deployments?
- How do we automate monitoring and maintenance across customer environments?
- What infrastructure choices enable this to scale?

### What's realistic for AI assistance in domain modeling?
**Current thinking**: Use AI to parse documents and suggest workflow structures, humans validate.

**Questions for partner**:
- What AI accuracy is realistic for business document parsing?
- How much human oversight is needed to make this practical?
- What's the minimum viable AI assistance that reduces manual effort?
- Should we build AI capabilities or use existing services?

## Business Model Viability

### Can we really achieve 80% template coverage?
**The assumption**: Most customer needs (80%) can be met by configuring existing components.

**Questions for partner**:
- Is this realistic based on your experience with business software?
- How do we measure and validate template coverage in practice?
- What happens to the business model if we can only achieve 60% coverage?
- How do we prevent customization requests from creeping beyond 20%?

### What's the real cost of "customer ownership"?
**The challenge**: Customers own their software but we need to support and update it.

**Questions for partner**:
- What does customer ownership mean technically and legally?
- How do we handle liability for software customers "own"?
- What's our support obligation for owned software?
- How do we balance ownership with our need to push updates?

## Open Questions for Partner Discussion

### Technical Feasibility
_Space for partner to answer:_
- Is the core concept technically sound or overly complex?
- What would you build differently for Phase 1?
- What are the biggest technical risks we haven't considered?

### Architecture Recommendations
_Space for partner to answer:_
- What technology stack would you recommend for rapid development?
- How would you handle the multi-deployment challenge?
- What's your recommended approach for component library architecture?

### Validation Strategy
_Space for partner to answer:_
- How should we prove technical feasibility quickly?
- What would you build first to test the riskiest assumptions?
- How long would it take to validate or invalidate this concept?

### Alternative Approaches
_Space for partner to answer:_
- Are there simpler ways to achieve similar customer outcomes?
- What would you do differently if this was your concept?
- Should we kill this idea? If so, why?

## Next Steps

This document is designed for collaborative discussion. Please:

1. **Answer the open questions** based on your technical experience
2. **Add questions we haven't considered** 
3. **Recommend a validation approach** to test feasibility quickly
4. **Give honest assessment** of whether this is worth pursuing

The goal is to either validate this is technically viable or learn early why it isn't.
