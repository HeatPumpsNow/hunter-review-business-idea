# Business Model Questions

## Q: Why won't this become a consulting company?
**A:** Consulting companies scale linearly with people. Our model scales through:

- Industry templates that capture 80% of needs upfront
- AI that reduces manual discovery by 70% in 6 months
- Evolution system that learns from all customers
- Implementation time dropping from 120 to 12 hours over 18 months

The key: we're productizing domain knowledge, not selling hours.

## Q: What if AI solves domain mapping in 2 years?
**A:** Two protective moats:

1. We're accumulating customer-specific workflow data that generic AI won't have
2. Compliance/regulatory knowledge requires constant updates that we're embedding

If AI can fully extract domain knowledge, we pivot to being the evolution engine that keeps software current with regulations and best practices. The ownership model and customer relationships remain.

## Q: What's the endgame: product company or service company?
**A:** Product company with domain expertise moat. Target metrics prove this:

- **Year 1**: 120 hours per customer (service-heavy)
- **Year 2**: 36 hours per customer (hybrid)
- **Year 3**: 12 hours per customer (product-dominant)
- 70% gross margins after infrastructure
- 95% retention rate (product metric, not service)

# Market Questions

## Q: Why not just use ServiceTitan or Procore?
**A:** They solve different problems:

- **ServiceTitan**: Great for simple service dispatch, fails at custom construction
- **Procore**: Built for large GCs, overkill and overpriced for SMBs
- Neither handles prevailing wage compliance well
- No ownership - you're renting forever
- Can't customize core workflows
- Don't evolve based on your specific usage

## Q: What's the first vertical and why?
**A:** HVAC/Electrical contractors doing prevailing wage work because:

- **Highest pain**: $94K+ penalties, 3-year debarment risk
- **Clearest ROI**: 340% return from compliance automation
- **Measurable value**: 4-6 hours/week saved immediately
- **Network effects**: Tight community, strong word-of-mouth
- **Template-friendly**: Similar workflows across companies

## Q: How do we compete with established players?
**A:** We don't compete head-on. We win by:

- Ownership vs rental (balance sheet asset)
- 3 weeks vs 6 months implementation
- Evolution vs static software
- Compliance built-in vs bolted-on
- $3K/month vs $8-12K total spend

# Scaling Questions

## Q: How do we scale to 50 customers without blowing up headcount?
**A:** Progressive automation strategy:

- **Months 1-6**: 1 pod (2 people) handles 10 customers/month
- **Months 7-12**: Templates reduce effort by 50%, same pod handles 20/month
- **Months 13-18**: AI automation cuts another 50%, handle 30/month
- **Target**: 50 customers/month with 5 pods (10 people) by month 24

## Q: What about complex implementations?
**A:** Three-tier approach:

- **Standard (80%)**: Use templates, 3-week deployment
- **Complex (15%)**: Add 1-2 weeks for unique workflows, charge more
- **Decline (5%)**: Not every customer fits our model

Complexity adds margin, not cost, because we charge for it.

## Q: How do we handle support at scale?
**A:** Evolution model reduces support need:

- **Month 1-3**: Higher touch during learning phase
- **Month 4+**: System has adapted, support drops 70%
- **Community**: Customers help each other
- **Self-service**: AI-powered documentation
- **Proactive**: Evolution prevents issues before they occur

# Technical Questions

## Q: What's our technical moat?
**A:** Three layers:

1. Domain knowledge encoded in templates
2. Customer workflow data that improves predictions
3. Compliance engine that updates automatically

The code itself isn't the moat - it's the domain expertise and data.

## Q: How do we handle security/compliance?
**A:** Standard enterprise requirements:

- SOC 2 Type II certification within 18 months
- HIPAA compliance for healthcare adjacency
- Data residency options for sensitive industries
- Customer owns and can export all data
- Regular third-party security audits

## Q: What about integration complexity?
**A:** API-first strategy:

- Pre-built connectors for top 20 tools (QuickBooks, etc.)
- Webhook architecture for real-time sync
- CSV import/export for everything else
- Customer owns integration code too

# Risk Questions

## Q: What if construction/manufacturing slows down?
**A:** Recession actually helps us:

- Companies focus on efficiency (our sweet spot)
- Compliance doesn't go away
- Lower margins make our ROI more critical
- Ownership model more appealing in uncertainty

## Q: What about payment processor channel conflict?
**A:** Carefully managed:

- They introduce, we own relationship
- We pay them for leads, not give software free
- Direct billing maintains control
- Build direct channels in parallel
- Exit strategy if channel becomes toxic

## Q: How do we prevent service creep?
**A:** Clear boundaries:

- Week 3 launch is MVP, not perfect
- Evolution captures additional needs over time
- Complex requests become paid add-ons
- "No" to out-of-scope until next evolution cycle
- Customer success metrics focused on adoption, not customization
