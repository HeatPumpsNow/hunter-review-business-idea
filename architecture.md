# Technical Architecture Concept

## Pipeline Overview

The core concept is a configuration pipeline that transforms business requirements into deployable, customer-owned applications. Here's the proposed flow:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐

## Component Library Architecture

**Think**: Like WordPress plugins or Shopify apps, but for business workflows

### Examples of Reusable Components
- **Quote/Estimate Generators**: Configurable for different industries and pricing models
- **Compliance Tracking**: Adaptable to various regulations (prevailing wage, safety, etc.)
- **Approval Workflows**: Customizable routing rules and business logic
- **Reporting Dashboards**: Configurable data sources and visualization formats
- **Integration Connectors**: API adapters for common business tools (QuickBooks, etc.)
- **Document Management**: File handling with industry-specific metadata

### Component Design Principles
- **Configurable, not customizable**: Parameters and business rules, not code changes
- **Composable**: Components work together through standard interfaces
- **Industry-specific**: Templates optimized for compliance-heavy workflows
- **Owned by customer**: Deployed instances belong to the customer

## Interface Problem

### Phase 1: Internal Configuration Only
- **Who configures**: Our team during onboarding process
- **Configuration method**: Internal admin tools and direct database/config file editing
- **Customer involvement**: Requirements gathering, validation, and approval only
- **Time estimate**: 3 weeks of our team's effort per customer

### Future Phases: Optional Customer-Facing Tools
- **Phase 3+**: Self-service configuration UI for customers
- **Reality check**: This may never be feasible - complex business logic is hard to abstract into user-friendly interfaces
- **Alternative**: Customers request changes, we implement through internal tools

**Key question for technical partner**: Is customer-facing configuration realistic, or should we plan for a managed service model?

## Technical Realities and Open Questions

### The Ownership Paradox
**The promise**: "Customers own their software"  
**The challenge**: How do you deliver updates, security patches, or improvements to software customers own?

**Possible approaches**:
- Customers own source code, we manage hosting and deployment
- Updates delivered as opt-in packages with change documentation
- Core platform owned by us, customer configurations and data owned by them
- Hybrid model: customers own their instance, we own the component library

**Open questions**:
- Which ownership model is technically feasible at scale?
- How do we handle critical security updates that can't be optional?
- What are the legal and liability implications?

### The Multi-Deployment Challenge
**The promise**: Each customer gets their own configured instance  
**The challenge**: How do we manage 100+ separate deployments efficiently?

**Technical requirements**:
- Automated CI/CD pipeline for customer-specific deployments
- Infrastructure as code for consistent environments
- Monitoring and maintenance across multiple instances
- Database isolation and backup strategies
- Security patching across all customer environments

**Open questions**:
- Single-tenant vs multi-tenant architecture?
- Container-based deployments or traditional hosting?
- How do we handle customer-specific integrations and customizations?
- What's the real operational cost at scale?

### The Telemetry Challenge
**The promise**: "Evolution based on usage patterns"  
**The challenge**: What data do we collect, how, and with what permission?

**Technical requirements**:
- Usage analytics infrastructure
- Data anonymization and privacy controls
- Pattern recognition and improvement suggestion algorithms
- Opt-in mechanism for sharing data and receiving suggestions

**Open questions**:
- What's the minimum viable telemetry for meaningful insights?
- How do we handle data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)?
- Should we build analytics infrastructure or use existing platforms?
- How do we turn usage data into actionable improvement suggestions?

### The Integration Complexity Problem
**The promise**: "Connects to your existing systems"  
**The challenge**: Every customer has different tools and integration requirements

**Current thinking**:
- Start with basic API connections and file imports/exports
- Build integration components for common business tools
- Handle edge cases through professional services (limited scope)

**Open questions**:
- How do we prevent integration work from overwhelming the platform model?
- Should we build integrations or partner with integration platforms?
- How do we price and scope integration work?
- What's our fallback for unsupported integrations?

## Phase Roadmap

### Phase 1: Manual Assembly (Months 1-6)
**Goal**: Prove template coverage and customer satisfaction

**Technical implementation**:
- Build 10-15 core components for one industry vertical
- Manual domain mapping and configuration process
- Simple deployment using existing hosting platforms
- Internal admin tools for configuration management

**Success metrics**:
- 3-5 successful customer implementations
- 80% of requirements met by existing components
- Implementation time under 3 weeks
- Customer satisfaction with core workflows

### Phase 2: Intake Automation (Months 7-12)
**Goal**: Reduce manual effort in domain modeling

**Technical additions**:
- AI document parsing and workflow extraction
- Structured interview tools and workflow validation UI
- Improved admin tools for faster configuration
- Component library expansion based on Phase 1 learnings

**Success metrics**:
- Implementation time reduced to 2 weeks
- AI accuracy sufficient for initial workflow drafts
- Reduced manual effort in requirements gathering

### Phase 3: Deployment Automation (Months 13-18)
**Goal**: Automate deployment and enable opt-in evolution

**Technical additions**:
- Automated CI/CD pipeline for customer deployments
- Usage telemetry collection (with privacy controls)
- Improvement suggestion engine
- Opt-in update mechanism for customer instances

**Success metrics**:
- Deployment time reduced to days, not weeks
- Customer opt-in rate for evolution suggestions
- Successfully managing 15+ customer environments

### Phase 4: Platform Scaling (Months 19+)
**Goal**: Scale to 50+ customers with minimal manual effort

**Technical additions** (if feasible):
- Customer-facing configuration tools
- Self-service onboarding flow
- Multi-industry component library
- Partner ecosystem for integrations

**Success metrics**:
- Customer acquisition without proportional increase in operational overhead
- Self-service adoption rates
- Platform revenue per employee

## Critical Technical Decisions Needed

### Infrastructure Architecture
- **Container orchestration** (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or traditional VMs?)
- **Database strategy** (single-tenant per customer or shared with isolation?)
- **CI/CD platform** (build custom or use existing solutions like GitLab, GitHub Actions?)
- **Monitoring and logging** (how do we handle monitoring across 100+ deployments?)

### Platform Technology Stack
- **Backend framework** (what enables rapid component development?)
- **Frontend technology** (admin tools and potential customer-facing interfaces)
- **Database technology** (what handles varying data structures across customers?)
- **Integration platform** (build custom or use existing solutions?)

### Security and Compliance
- **Data isolation** (how do we prevent customer data leakage?)
- **Access controls** (how do customers and our team access different environments?)
- **Compliance certifications** (SOC2, HIPAA - what's required and when?)
- **Backup and disaster recovery** (across multiple customer environments)

## Questions for Technical Partner

1. **Feasibility Assessment**: Is this pipeline concept technically realistic, or are we underestimating complexity?

2. **Architecture Recommendations**: What technology stack would you choose for Phase 1 vs. the full vision?

3. **Risk Prioritization**: Which technical challenges should we solve first vs. later?

4. **Alternative Approaches**: Are there simpler ways to achieve similar customer outcomes?

5. **Build vs. Buy**: What should we build in-house vs. use existing platforms for?

6. **Validation Strategy**: How should we prove technical feasibility quickly and cheaply?

This architecture is a starting point for discussion, not a final design. The goal is to identify what's buildable, what's aspirational, and what needs to be reconsidered entirely.
