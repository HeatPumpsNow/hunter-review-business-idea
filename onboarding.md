# The Scalability Challenge

## Why Onboarding Can Kill the Model

- **Traditional custom development**: 40+ hours of discovery per client
- **Current SaaS**: 6-12 weeks of configuration and training
- **The trap**: Becoming a 100-person services company with software margins
- **The solution**: 80/20 templated approach with AI-assisted mapping
