# Build Plan: From Manual Service to Automated Platform

## Reality Check

This plan outlines a progression from a labor-intensive consulting service to an automated platform. **We don't know if this evolution is technically or economically feasible.** The goal is to test assumptions quickly and kill bad ideas early.

## Phase 1: Manual Assembly (Months 1-6)
**Goal**: Prove template coverage and customer value

### What to Build Now
**Component Library Foundation**
- 10-15 core components for one vertical (construction/trades)
- Quote generators with industry-specific pricing models
- Compliance tracking for prevailing wage and certified payroll
- Basic project management workflows
- Simple reporting and dashboard components

**Internal Tools**
- Requirements gathering templates and interview guides  
- Component configuration admin interface (basic CRUD)
- Manual deployment scripts and hosting setup
- Customer validation and feedback collection system

**Process Documentation**
- Domain mapping methodology (how we translate business needs to components)
- Component configuration procedures
- Deployment and testing checklists
- Customer onboarding workflow

### Success Criteria
- Complete 3-5 customer implementations
- Achieve 80% template coverage (only 20% requires custom work)
- Implementation time consistently under 3 weeks
- Customer satisfaction scores indicate they would recommend to peers
- Component reuse rate across customers proves platform viability

### Phase 1 Budget Reality
- **Development effort**: 6-12 months for 2-3 developers
- **Customer acquisition**: Manual sales process, industry connections
- **Operational overhead**: High - each customer requires significant hands-on work
- **Break-even**: Not expected in Phase 1

## Phase 2: Intake Automation (Months 7-12)
**Goal**: Reduce manual effort in requirements gathering

### Technical Additions
**AI-Assisted Domain Modeling**
- Document parsing for SOPs, spreadsheets, existing workflows
- LLM-based workflow extraction and suggestion engine
- Structured interview tools with branching logic
- Validation UI for reviewing AI-generated workflow maps

**Improved Admin Tools**
- Visual workflow designer for mapping business processes
- Component library browser with search and filtering
- Configuration templates for common industry patterns
- Automated testing for component combinations

### Success Criteria
- Implementation time reduced from 3 weeks to 2 weeks
- AI accuracy sufficient for initial workflow drafts (humans refine, don't start from scratch)
- 50% reduction in manual requirements gathering time
- Component library expanded based on Phase 1 customer patterns

### Risk Mitigation
- **If AI accuracy is too low**: Fall back to manual process with AI as research assistant
- **If automation doesn't reduce time**: Focus on standardizing manual processes instead
- **If component complexity explodes**: Limit scope, reject customers who don't fit templates

## Phase 3: Deployment Automation (Months 13-18)
**Goal**: Automate assembly and deployment, enable evolution

### Technical Additions
**Automated Pipeline**
- CI/CD system for customer-specific deployments
- Infrastructure as code for consistent environments
- Automated testing and validation before deployment
- Rollback mechanisms for failed deployments

**Evolution Infrastructure**
- Usage telemetry collection (privacy-first design)
- Analytics pipeline for identifying improvement opportunities
- Suggestion engine for component updates and new features
- Opt-in update mechanism with customer approval workflow

### Success Criteria
- Deployment time reduced to days instead of weeks
- Successfully managing 15+ customer environments with minimal manual intervention
- 70% customer opt-in rate for evolution suggestions
- Measurable improvements in customer workflows from suggested changes

### Major Risk: Complexity Explosion
If managing multiple deployments becomes unmanageable, we fall back to managed service model rather than automated platform.

## Phase 4: Platform Scaling (Months 19+)
**Goal**: Scale to 50+ customers without proportional operational overhead

### Technical Additions (If Feasible)
**Customer-Facing Tools**
- Self-service configuration interface (simplified)
- Customer portal for managing their instance
- Basic customization tools for power users
- Integration marketplace for third-party connections

**Platform Infrastructure**
- Multi-industry component libraries
- Partner ecosystem for integrations and add-ons
- Advanced analytics and predictive improvement suggestions
- White-label capabilities for channel partners

### Reality Check
This phase may not be technically or economically viable. Alternative: remain a managed service with automation behind the scenes.

## Automation Roadmap

| Phase | Human Hours per Customer | AI Automation Level | Key Dependencies |
|-------|--------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Phase 1** | 120 hours (3 weeks) | None - manual process | Component library, admin tools |
| **Phase 2** | 80 hours (2 weeks) | AI-assisted domain modeling | LLM integration, document parsing |
| **Phase 3** | 40 hours (1 week) | Automated deployment | CI/CD pipeline, telemetry system |
| **Phase 4** | 20 hours (0.5 weeks) | Customer self-service | Self-service UI, platform scaling |

### Automation Success Metrics
- **Template Coverage**: 80% of customer needs met by existing components
- **Time Reduction**: 4x improvement from Phase 1 to Phase 4
- **Quality Maintenance**: Customer satisfaction remains high despite reduced manual effort
- **Cost Structure**: Unit economics improve with each phase

### Failure Points
- **Phase 1**: If 80% template coverage proves impossible, business model fails
- **Phase 2**: If AI can't meaningfully assist domain modeling, automation stalls
- **Phase 3**: If deployment complexity explodes, we become operations-heavy
- **Phase 4**: If customer-facing tools are too complex, we remain a managed service

## Technical Stack Recommendations (For Discussion)

### Phase 1: Keep It Simple
- **Backend**: Django/Rails for rapid development, PostgreSQL for data
- **Frontend**: Simple admin interface, minimal customer-facing tools
- **Hosting**: Standard cloud hosting (AWS/GCP), manual deployment
- **Component Architecture**: Modular Django apps or similar framework

### Phase 2-3: Add Automation Infrastructure
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API or similar for document parsing
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated deployment
- **Monitoring**: Basic logging and error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- **Analytics**: Simple usage tracking, potentially using existing tools

### Phase 4: Platform Infrastructure (If Needed)
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes for multi-tenant deployments
- **Advanced Analytics**: Custom analytics infrastructure or enterprise tools
- **API Gateway**: For customer integrations and partner ecosystem
- **Self-Service UI**: React/Vue.js for customer configuration tools

## Build vs. Buy Decisions

### Definitely Build
- Core component library (this is our competitive advantage)
- Domain mapping and configuration tools (industry-specific knowledge)
- Customer deployment and management system (our ownership model)

### Definitely Buy/Use Existing
- Basic hosting and infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Authentication and user management (Auth0, Firebase Auth, etc.)
- Payment processing (Stripe, similar)
- Basic monitoring and logging (existing tools)

### Evaluate Later
- AI/ML infrastructure (build vs. OpenAI API vs. other services)
- Advanced analytics platform (build vs. enterprise tools)
- Integration platform (build vs. Zapier/Integromat-style services)
- Customer support and communication tools

## Validation Approach

### Phase 1 Validation
1. **Build one complete customer implementation manually**
2. **Document every step and component created**
3. **Measure actual time vs. estimated time**
4. **Validate customer satisfaction and business impact**
5. **Assess component reusability with second customer**

### Technical Feasibility Tests
1. **Component Assembly**: Can we reliably assemble components into working applications?
2. **Deployment Automation**: How complex is customer-specific deployment really?
3. **Integration Handling**: What percentage of customer integrations can we standardize?
4. **Update Mechanism**: Can we push updates to "owned" software in practice?

### Go/No-Go Decision Points
- **After Month 3**: Are we achieving 80% template coverage?
- **After Month 6**: Are we consistently under 3 weeks implementation time?
- **After Month 12**: Has AI assistance meaningfully reduced manual effort?
- **After Month 18**: Can we manage 15+ deployments without breaking?

## Questions for Technical Partner

1. **Phase 1 Feasibility**: What's the simplest viable approach for the component library and assembly system?

2. **Automation Realism**: Are the time reduction targets (120 hours â†’ 20 hours) realistic, or are we being too optimistic?

3. **Technical Debt Risks**: What architectural decisions in Phase 1 could prevent scaling in later phases?

4. **Alternative Approaches**: Is there a simpler way to achieve similar customer outcomes without building a full platform?

5. **Validation Strategy**: How would you quickly test whether this concept is technically viable?

This build plan is optimistic by design. The goal is to test whether this progression is possible, not to commit to building all four phases. We should be prepared to stop at any phase if the technical complexity or economics don't work.
