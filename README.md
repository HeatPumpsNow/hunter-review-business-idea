# AI-Assisted Domain Software for SMB Construction & Manufacturing

## Executive Summary

We're building ownable, evolving software for mid-market construction and manufacturing companies trapped between rigid SaaS and expensive custom development.

**The opportunity**: $10.5-15B market with only 4% of construction companies using AI despite proven 15% productivity gains. Current solutions fail with 70% implementation failure rates and force businesses to adapt to software rather than software adapting to business.

**Our solution**: In 3 weeks, companies own software built for their exact workflows that evolves monthly with AI-driven improvements. They pay $3K/month instead of $12K for disconnected tools, eliminate 14+ hours weekly waste, and build a balance sheet asset instead of an expense.

## The Problem

Construction companies lose 35% of professional time to manual data entry, risk $94K+ compliance penalties, and miss $50-200K annually in rebates. They use 5+ disconnected tools costing $8-12K/month.

Manufacturers take days to weeks for custom quotes, lose 5% revenue to tool fragmentation, and see 15% production slowdowns from manual processes.

Both suffer from 70% software implementation failure rates and are forced to choose between:
- Rigid SaaS that doesn't fit their workflows
- Custom development costing $200K+ and taking 6-12 months

## Our Solution

### 3-Week Implementation
- **Week 1**: AI-assisted domain mapping captures 80% of workflows
- **Week 2**: Configuration using industry templates
- **Week 3**: Launch with core workflows operational

### Monthly Evolution
- AI analyzes usage patterns
- Compliance updates applied automatically
- Customer-requested features prioritized
- System gets smarter every month

### Ownership Model
- Customer owns the code (balance sheet asset)
- No vendor lock-in
- Appreciates in value over time
- Can be sold with the business

## Why Now?

**Technology Timing**: AI can generate code (70-90% faster) but can't extract domain knowledge. This 18-36 month window is our opportunity.

**Market Pressure**: 68% of construction companies can't fill roles, forcing automation. Infrastructure Investment Act driving 10+ month backlogs.

**Competitive Gap**: Nobody serves the $15-35M revenue segment well. Too small for enterprise, too complex for SMB solutions.

## Current Status

- ✅ Concept validation through 3-week HVAC ERP build
- ✅ Market research complete: Clear $10.5-15B opportunity
- ✅ Technical approach validated: 80/20 template model works
- ✅ Go-to-market strategy defined: Direct + associations

## Next Steps

1. Build first 3 customer implementations (validate 3-week timeline)
2. Develop HVAC/Electrical templates
3. Create compliance automation engine
4. Document patterns for scaling
