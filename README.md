# Configurable Business Software Platform Concept

## Honest Translation

**We're not building magic AI that evolves software automatically. We're building a pipeline that makes custom software faster and more repeatable, starting with templates + AI-assisted domain modeling. Over time, we add tools that help the software improve based on real usage data—but customers always opt-in to changes.**

This is a conversation starter for exploring whether this concept is technically and commercially viable. It requires significant technical expertise to validate feasibility and design the right architecture.

## Current State vs Future Vision

### Phase 1: Managed Service (Today)
- Heavy human involvement in domain mapping and assembly
- Manual deployment and configuration
- Internal tools only - no customer self-service
- Focus on proving the 80/20 template coverage rule

### Future Vision: Semi-Automated Pipeline
- AI-assisted intake reduces manual domain modeling
- Automated component assembly and deployment
- Optional customer-facing configuration tools
- Usage-based improvement suggestions (opt-in only)
- SaaS-like platform experience with ownership benefits

**Reality check**: We don't know if this evolution is technically feasible or economically viable.

## The Core Idea

Companies with complex workflows ($15-35M revenue) are stuck between rigid SaaS and expensive custom development. We think there's an opportunity to create a **pipeline for configurable, ownable software** that:

1. **Domain modeling** - AI-assisted intake captures business workflows from documents and conversations
2. **Translation layer** - Maps verified domain models to a growing library of pre-built components  
3. **Assembly & deployment** - Generates customer-specific software from those components
4. **Evolution layer** - Proposes improvements over time based on usage patterns (customer opt-in only)

**Customer promise**: They own their configured software instance built from our component library, but we host and manage it if they choose. They pay for hosting, assistance, and access to the configuration platform.

## What This Is Not

**Not pure SaaS**: Customers own their configured instance, not just a subscription  
**Not fully custom development**: We use a shared component library for speed and affordability  
**Not magic AI automation**: AI assists with domain modeling, humans validate and configure  
**Not one-size-fits-all**: Industry-specific templates adapted to individual workflows  
**Not consulting with AI buzzwords**: We're building reusable components, not bespoke solutions

**Think**: Shopify or WordPress for business workflows—templates, components, and ownership—but for compliance-heavy industries like construction and manufacturing.

## Unresolved Technical Questions

This concept has significant technical unknowns that need your input:

### Architecture & Deployment
- **Multi-tenancy vs single-tenancy**: How do we handle 100+ customer deployments?
- **CI/CD pipeline**: How do we automate deployment while maintaining customer ownership?
- **Update mechanism**: How do customers receive updates to "owned" software?
- **Security & compliance**: How do we maintain SOC2/HIPAA across customer environments?

### Platform Complexity
- **Component library**: What abstraction level works for business workflows?
- **Integration complexity**: How do we handle the long tail of customer system integrations?
- **Telemetry & privacy**: What data do we collect vs. what customers will accept?
- **Edge cases**: How do we handle requirements that don't fit templates?

### Business Model Viability
- **Automation targets**: Can we reduce implementation from 120 hours → 12 hours?
- **Template coverage**: Is 80% reusable components realistic?
- **Service creep prevention**: How do we avoid becoming a consulting company?
- **Unit economics**: What's the real cost of customer-specific deployments?

## Request for Feedback

This concept needs technical validation before it's worth pursuing. We're looking for honest assessment of:

1. **Is the technical architecture sound?** Does the pipeline concept make sense or is it overly complex?
2. **What are we missing?** What technical challenges aren't we considering?
3. **How would you build this?** What would Phase 1 actually look like technically?
4. **Should we kill this idea?** If the technical complexity outweighs the business opportunity, let's find that out early.

Feel free to challenge any assumptions, poke holes in the logic, or suggest completely different approaches. The goal is to either validate this is worth building or learn why it isn't.
