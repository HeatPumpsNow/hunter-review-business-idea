# Business Strategy and Model

## The Market Opportunity

Companies with complex operations ($15-35M revenue) are underserved by current software options. They're too complex for simple SaaS tools but too small for enterprise solutions. The opportunity is in the middle: custom software that's faster and cheaper than traditional development.

**Key insight**: These businesses will pay for software they own rather than rent, especially if it adapts to their specific workflows rather than forcing them to adapt.

## Pricing Concept

### Revenue Structure
- **Setup fee**: $15-30K for initial template implementation and customization
- **Hosting/management**: $1-3K/month for infrastructure and basic support  
- **Evolution subscription**: $1-2K/month for improvement suggestions and opt-in updates (optional)

**Total customer cost**: $3-5K/month vs. $8-12K they currently spend on multiple disconnected tools

### Why This Pricing Works
- Cheaper than current total cost of ownership
- Creates balance sheet asset vs. pure expense
- Aligns our incentives with customer success (evolution subscription)
- Sustainable for our cost structure if we can automate delivery

## Risks

### Service Creep Risk
**Problem**: Each customer wants custom features, turning us into a consulting company

**Mitigation strategies**:
- Hard boundaries on implementation scope (3 weeks maximum)
- Additional features go into evolution queue, not immediate custom work
- Template coverage targets (80% of needs met by standard components)
- Clear "no" to requests that don't fit the model

### Template Commoditization
**Problem**: As templates become standard, competitors copy our approach

**Defensibility**:
- Industry-specific expertise and compliance knowledge
- Customer data and usage patterns for improvement suggestions
- Speed of execution and operational excellence
- Network effects within industry verticals

### High-Touch Onboarding
**Problem**: Manual implementation process doesn't scale economically

**Path to automation**:
- Phase 1: Manual but repeatable processes
- Phase 2: AI-assisted domain modeling
- Phase 3: Automated deployment pipeline
- Phase 4: Customer self-service (if feasible)

**Fallback**: Remain a premium managed service if full automation proves impossible

## Target Market Focus

### Phase 1: Construction/Trades
- Industries with severe regulatory penalties (prevailing wage compliance)
- Clear ROI from avoided compliance violations
- Strong industry networks for referrals
- Willingness to pay premium for ownership model

### Phase 2: Adjacent Industries
- Custom manufacturing with certification requirements
- Professional services with compliance obligations
- Any business with complex workflows that don't fit standard software

### Customer Characteristics
- $15-35M annual revenue (complex enough for custom, budget for solution)
- Currently using 3+ disconnected tools
- Compliance or regulatory requirements
- Willing to pay for ownership vs. rental

## Key Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Validation
- Implementation time consistently under 3 weeks
- 80% template coverage across first 5 customers
- Customer satisfaction scores indicating referral likelihood
- Component reuse rate proving platform viability

### Platform Viability
- Customer acquisition cost vs. lifetime value
- Implementation time reduction trajectory (120 hours â†’ 20 hours)
- Revenue per employee (automation indicator)
- Customer retention and expansion rates

## Critical Questions for Technical Partner

1. **Technical feasibility**: Are the automation targets realistic?
2. **Architecture implications**: How do technical choices affect unit economics?
3. **Build vs. buy**: What should we build vs. use existing platforms?
4. **Risk assessment**: What are the biggest technical risks to the business model?

The viability of this business model depends entirely on our ability to automate custom software delivery while maintaining quality and customer satisfaction. Technical architecture decisions will determine whether this is profitable or just an expensive consulting business.
